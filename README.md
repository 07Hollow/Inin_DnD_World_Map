# Inin_DnD_World_Map
A Website for our dnd campaign, including the worldmap and more


I working on a website for my DM. Its a website with our Camapign Map on it. 
It will provide some functions, like zoom in and out or drag the map like you can do with google maps. 
An additional function would be (is not included right now) to search for countries or cities. 
In the nav bar are some important links like dnd beyond, dnd wiki, forgotten realms fandom and Roll20

Thanks to everyone on the internet who has been such great help when it comes to problems in the code. But also of course for the inspirations.
